In this step we will start the Elasticsearch service and ensure it's running correctly.

##Â Start the Elasticsearch service

Using systemctl commands we can check the status and start up the Elasticsearch service:

`systemctl start elasticsearch`{{execute}}

As we're using the default settings, Elasticsearch should start up without problems:

`systemctl status elasticsearch`{{execute}}

By default Elasticsearch binds to two ports: 9200 for HTTP traffic and 9300 for transport layer traffic.  
We can confirm these ports using the netsat command:

`netstat -tulpn | grep '9200\|9300'`{{execute interrupt}}


Open `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`{{open}} and navigate to the **Network** settings

```
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
#
# Set the bind address to a specific IP (IPv4 or IPv6):
#
#network.host: 192.168.0.1
#
# Set a custom port for HTTP:
#
#http.port: 9200
#
# For more information, consult the network module documentation.
```

If needed you can change these ports in the elasticsearch.yml with the below settings:

`transport.port: 9300`

and

`network.port: 9200`

However for our purposes we will keep the default settings.
